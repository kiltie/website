<H2>Prospective Members</H2>

The Kiltie Band is one of the best ways to have some fun outside of classes.  You'll meet plenty of crazy and fun people, you'll be able to continue playing your instrument (or learn a new one!), and there's <b>no audition required</b>.  That's right: we're a very accepting community, pulling from a wide range of talent and experience.  Whether you were a high school virtuoso or just a casual acquaintance with your instrument, we'd love to see you come out and play.<br><br>

Our first rehearsal of the year will be held in the Connan Room of the University Center on Monday August 27th at 5:30pm.  Bring your instrument and your sense of humor.<br><br>

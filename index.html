Started in 1908 by a group of just seven students dedicated to
supporting Carnegie Tech football, today's Kiltie Band continues a
tradition of excellence originated nearly a century ago... At least
that's what our recruiting brochure says.  We wear kilts, act crazy,
and have lots of fun with our instruments.

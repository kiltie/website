<p>
Started in 1908 by a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated nearly a century ago... At least that's what our recruiting brochure says.  We wear kilts, act crazy, and have lots of fun with our instruments.

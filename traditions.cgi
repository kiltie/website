<p>
The Kiltie Band has a rich history of traditions, which have been passed 
down over the years.  We're working on compiling a list of as many as we can 
possibly come up with.  If you have ever been a Kiltie (or an uber-fan) and
 would like to write about a particular tradition, please get in touch with 
the <script>emailer2("jphoa","andrew.cmu.edu","webmaster");</script>.
